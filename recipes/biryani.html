    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Prepare the chicken curry:</b> Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken. Start the chicken curry. While the chicken cooks over low heat, make the rice. </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Prepare the rice:</b> Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside. </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Bring it all together for a final steam (‘dum‘):</b> Layer half of the rice, all of the chicken, and then the remaining rice on top. Add the finishing touches. Allow steam to develop, then lower the heat and let the flavors meld.</p></li>
