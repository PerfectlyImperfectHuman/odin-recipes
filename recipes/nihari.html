    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nihari is the most popular traditional breakfast of Pakistan. The key to a great nihari is intentional depth of flavor. Deeply brown onions, fresh spices infusing the oil, meat that’s properly braised..all this contributes to the revered taste of nihari. Here’s an easy Nihari (Pakistani Beef Stew) recipe that requires 1 pot and less than 30 minutes of initial prep time. This recipe includes stovetop & slow cooker instructions for tender beef shank (or stew) meat.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Brown the onions & meat:</b> Deeply brown onions (refer to the video rather than the pic for reference) give flavor, body, and depth to Nihari. Like with most stews, searing the meat so that it browns is essential, but don’t sear for too long as it can lead to tough meat.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Bloom Spices:</b> Add spices and allow them to cook in the hot oil. If you’re worried about them burning, you can always add a splash of water.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cook:</b> For stovetop, allow it to come to a boil before lowering the heat to a simmer. For slow cooker, transfer the mixture to a slow cooker, add water and mix to combine.</p></li>
        <li><p><b><b>Thicken:</b> If you try to thicken the gravy by adding in flour, it will result in clumps. To avoid this, remove some of the nihari liquid (I always found using water dilutes the taste) and allow it to cool. Then stir it into the atta flour. Add this slurry to the nihari while stirring to prevent clumps. Allow this to cook and thicken.</p></li>
