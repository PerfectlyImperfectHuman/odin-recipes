    <h3>How to make Chicken Biryani – 3 Main Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Heat the oil and brown the chopped onions:</b> Sauté the onions until they’re lightly golden. Then add garlic, ginger, and green chili pepper. The onions will deepen in color as the aromatics cook.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Sauté the chicken:</b> This technique, called ‘bhunai‘ sears the meat and gives it richer flavor and color. A sprinkle of salt here helps layer the flavor.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Add the tomatoes, spices, and salt:</b> The moisture from all the tomatoes will be enough to cook the chicken while keeping it moist.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cover & cook:</b> Allowing the chicken to slowly simmer while covered results in tender chicken and well-developed flavors. This also helps the tomatoes break down well.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Uncover and stir-fry on high heat to sauté out the water content:</b> You’re done once the chicken taking on a glossy appearance as the ghee/oil starts to separate.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Stir in the yogurt:/b> I experimented with adding yogurt earlier but found I loved the pronounced taste and consistency it gives when added at the end. After adding the yogurt, continue to cook it through until the oil starts leaving the sides again. </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Finish off</b> with freshly ground black peppercorns and garam masala and stir to mix. Garnish with green chili peppers, julienned ginger, and cilantro.</p></li>
    </ol>
